With this app you can set up a pre-trained image classification model. It Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, an image dataset
containing 10 classes of various objects such as airplanes, cars, and birds. Using TensorFlow, an open-source machine
learning library, to build and train the model.

## How could this be used in practice?
Computer vision and image recognition can be used to help engineers in a variety of ways, such as:
- Quality control: Engineers can use image recognition to inspect products for defects, such as scratches or cracks, 
during the manufacturing process, or to check diagrams for errors or anomalies.
- Inspection: Engineers can use computer vision to inspect infrastructure, such as bridges or pipelines, for signs of 
wear or damage.
- Medical imaging: Engineers can use image recognition to improve the diagnostic accuracy of medical imaging systems 
such as x-ray, CT, and MRI.
- Smart agriculture: Engineers can use computer vision to monitor crop growth, detect pests, and make decisions about 
irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting
